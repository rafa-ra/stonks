#### Description:

For my final project in CS50, I am thrilled to present a comprehensive stock trading platform designed to revolutionize the way users engage with the financial markets. This platform offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that empowers individuals to buy, sell, and manage stocks with ease and confidence. Built upon a robust foundation of modern web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, this platform seamlessly integrates real-time stock market data, enabling users to make informed investment decisions in an ever-changing market landscape. With features such as portfolio management, real-time price updates and transaction tracking, this stock trading platform aims to provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools to navigate the complexities of stock trading and achieve their financial goals.

Undoubtedly, my project doesn't deviate from the fundamental proposition inherent in the final Python problem set utilizing Flask. However, its essence lies in an ambitious endeavor to construct every component from the ground up, employing an entirely distinct technology stack. Each technology selected boasts widespread adoption across companies of varying scales, ranging from nimble startups to industry-leading multinationals. This deliberate choice was driven by a dual purpose: to craft a captivating project that enriches my existing portfolio and propels my career trajectory forward, all while delivering a robust solution to the culminating challenge presented by CS50.

Expanding upon the technological foundation of our project, **Javascript** emerged as the cornerstone, embodying its reputation as a versatile programming language renowned for providing web pages with interactivity and dynamic features, leveraging an extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Integration of JavaScript ensures the creation of a responsive and immersive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience. Complementing this, **Node.js** was chosen given its context as a robust server-side framework, being responsible for incoming requests, connection management, and execution of server-side logic. Node.js enables developers to craft scalable and high-performance web applications, all while operating within the familiar framework of JavaScript.

Side by side with Node.js, **Express.js** was used. Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the process of building web servers and APIs. In our project, Express.js provides a streamlined and modular approach to defining routes, handling requests, and middleware integration, allowing us to quickly develop robust backend APIs for our stock trading platform. Its advantages include its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive middleware ecosystem, which simplifies tasks such as authentication, session management, and error handling. By adopting Express.js, we ensure a clean and organized codebase, facilitating rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Acting similarly to what is provided by Flask, **EJS** was chosen to be the template engine. EJS is a simple and powerful templating language that enables developers to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side. In our project, EJS is utilized to generate dynamic web pages for rendering server-side views of stock data, user portfolios, and transaction history. Its advantages include its familiarity to developers already proficient in HTML and JavaScript, as well as its support for template inheritance and partials, which promote code reusability and maintainability.

As the database management system, the project makes use of MySQL, which is a widely-used open-source relational database management system known for its reliability, performance, and scalability. In **Stonks**, MySQL serves as the backend database for storing and managing user account information, stock data, transaction records, and other critical data. Alongside, Sequelize is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js that simplifies database interactions by providing a higher-level abstraction over SQL queries. In our project, Sequelize is used to define database models, perform CRUD operations, and manage database migrations, reducing the complexity of database interactions and promoting code maintainability.

**Stonks** was developed employing the MVC design pattern, where the acronym stands for Models, Views and Controllers, respectively. In the Models folder, the Model represents the data and business logic of the application, encapsulating the data and providing methods to manipulate it. In the Models folder, one should find the files transaction.js, user_stocks.js and user.js, which were extensively used in the controller files. The User Model represents the users of the platform. It includes fields for the user's ID, username, password hash, and cash balance. The user's cash balance is defaulted to $10,000. This model establishes a relationship with the UserStocks model through a foreign key relationship. The UserStocks Model represents the stocks owned by users. It includes fields for the ID, user ID, stock symbol, number of shares owned, and the price at which the shares were purchased. This model also establishes a relationship with the User model through a foreign key relationship. Lastly, the Transaction model, that represents transactions made by users on the platform. It includes fields for the transaction ID, user ID, stock symbol, price per share, number of shares bought or sold, total transaction amount, transaction type (purchase or sale), and timestamps for creation and update. This model also establishes a relationship with the User model through a foreign key relationship.

In the Views folder, all EJS files will be found. As a subfolder, "Includes" contain navigation.ejs and end.ejs, that are used by all other ejs files as the head and the end of each lately converted HTML file. In Views root folder buy.ejs, index.ejs, quote.ejs, quoted.ejs, sell.ejs, signup.ejs and transactions.ejs provide user interface for what their names suggest the user can do at the application. Apart from HTML tags, these files are responsible for receving information from the server-side and displaying it to the user making use of logic and variables insertion.

The app.js sitting in the root folder centralizes all file and module imports and also starts the server once the database is connected.

The routes.js file centralizes all routes in the application, removing unnecessary code from the controller files.

Finally, in the Controllers folder, four files can be found. In logging.js, are all logging-related functions that will be called once a request is made to the loggin routes. In the getSignup, postSignup, getLogin, postLogin and logout will tell the rest of the application whether the user is registered and logged in or not. The quote.js file contains the get and the post requests to return the page and quoting the stocks employing the axios external module to make requests to an external api. In the trading.js file the controllers for buying and selling stocks will intermediate the user inputs and their respective data, guaranteeing that the users only interact with their own data, given that they have available stock or cash balance to do so. In transactions.js, the getTransactions and getHomeInfo controllers will return to the user the transactions and the home page, respectively, containing only information related to that user. It is important to mention again that all the database interactions are made through sequelize models.
